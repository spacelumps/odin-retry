        <em>Vegtable lasagna</em> 

        <p>This quick and easy Vegetable Lasagna recipe is a simple and cozy casserole that comes together with just 40 minutes of prep! Loaded with fresh veggies and plenty of gooey, melty cheese, the healthy dinner is a delicious comfort food classic that the whole family will love!</p>
        <p> A warm and hearty vegetable lasagna is the best way to get your family to eat their veggies! While my kids (and husband) have certain vegetables that they enjoy, it can often be a challenge to encourage new or different options. If there's one thing that I've learned after raising three boys, it's that combining vegetables with pasta or a cheesy casserole is always more appealing than plain, raw produce on a plate.</p>
